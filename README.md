# Vidyalaya---Telugu-Language-learning-platform
AI - powered Telugu Language Learning platform with grammar and pronunciation analysis

Language learning in morphologically rich, low-
resource languages like Telugu presents unique challenges due
to the scarcity of intelligent, adaptive learning tools that offer
real-time, personalized feedback. Most existing platforms prior-
itize globally dominant languages and often lack the linguistic
depth and cultural sensitivity required to support regional
learners effectively. Addressing this gap, this research introduces
Vidy¯alaya, an AI-powered, bilingual language learning platform
designed specifically for Telugu.

The system integrates Large
Language Models (LLMs) for grammar analysis and Wav2Vec2-
based speech recognition to assess pronunciation from spoken
input. 

It provides immediate, bilingual feedback — including
grammar corrections, pronunciation evaluations, and contextual
explanations in both Telugu and English — aimed at enhancing
learner comprehension and fluency.

To improve adaptability across varying language proficiencies,
we employ zero-shot and few-shot learning techniques via the
Mistral API. Our evaluation reveals that few-shot prompting
significantly outperforms zero-shot, offering deeper contextual
understanding and more accurate corrections. The platform also
features an interactive chatbot capable of handling translations,
definitions, and grammar assistance in both languages. With an
intuitive user interface and culturally aware design, Vidy¯alaya
offers a holistic and scalable solution that bridges the gap between
AI-driven language education and the linguistic diversity of India
